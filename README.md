# mqtt-ir-transceiver

Gateway between MQTT and IR signal

Setup an IR receiver on pin 3, an IR transmitter on pin 0 (DEBUG MODE).

Download the included libraries to your arduino IDE libraries folder (please take care of having the last versions of library), for example previous versions of pubsubclient.h could generate compilation errors)
Upload the sketch to your ESP8266
Connect to the ESP8266 directly by wifi, adress should be 192.168.4.1
Enter your configuration parameters (if you don't have an mqtt user and password just set nothing)
You are ready

If you need to reset the config file just connect pin 6 to the ground (DEBUG MODE).
